# Social Media for Pet Lovers

## Description
This app will model Instagram as a social media platform for pet lovers to create accounts for their pets and connect with other pet lovers. We plan to create the following features: the ability to create an account, add photos with captions, and search for other users or posts. 
If we have time: follow other users, add an ability to like photos, add comments, direct message users, and add videos (or the links from YouTube). Double bonus: set up the application to send the user an email for various reasons.

## Technologies to Use:
Node
Express
Handlebars
MYSQL
Sequelize
Sharp
Multer
Socket.io

## User Story
As a -insert app name-  user, I want to be able to create or log in to my own account. I want to be able to add my own post- an image with a caption. I want to be able to access and view the latest posts from accounts that I follow. It would also be nice if I could follow my favorite users, like their post, comment on posts, and direct message them.
